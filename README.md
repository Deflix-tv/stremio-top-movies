This addon is a remote addon, so it's an HTTP web service and Stremio just sends HTTP requests to it. You dont't need to run any untrusted code on your machine.

You only have to enter the addon URL in the search box of the addons section of Stremio, like this:  
`https://stremio-top-movies.deflix.tv/manifest.json`

That's it!

Run locally

Alternatively you can also run the addon locally and use that in Stremio. The addon is written in Go and compiles to a single executable file without dependencies, so it's really easy to run on your machine.

You can use one of the precompiled binaries from GitHub:

1. Download the binary for your OS from <https://github.com/doingodswork/stremio-top-movies/releases>
2. Simply run the executable binary
3. To stop the program press `Ctrl-C` (or `âŒƒ-C` on macOS)

Or use Docker:

1. `docker pull doingodswork/stremio-top-movies`
2. `docker run --name stremio-top-movies -v /path/to/data:/data -p 8080:8080 doingodswork/stremio-top-movies`
3. To stop the container: `docker stop stremio-top-movies`

Then similar to installing the publicly hosted addon you just enter the following URL in the search box of the addon section of Stremio:  
`http://localhost:8080/manifest.json`
